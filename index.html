		<h1>‚ùÑÔ∏èüçë</h1>
		<p>
			Freezepeach for the Fediverse.
		</p>
		<h2>Freezepeach Fediverse Servers with Open Registration</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a target="_blank" href="https://poa.st">poa.st</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>What makes a server "freezepeach"?</h2>
		<p>
			Broadly speaking, servers whose anti-authoritarian operators take a principled stance on freedom of expression.
			<br>
			<blockquote>
				I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.
				<br>
				-Voltaire
			</blockquote>
			Freezepeach servers are operated by individuals who do not editorialize or censor user posts with the exception of obscenity.
		</p>
		<h3>Section 230</h3>
			<p>
			Section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act makes the interactive internet possible, as service operators cannot be held liable for content produced by users:
			<br>
			<blockquote>
			<b>(c)(1)</b>
				No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.
			</blockquote>
			<br>
			Section 230 also allows operators to censor material without laibility:
			<br>
			<blockquote>
			<b>(c)(2)</b>
				No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider <b>or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable</b>, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected
			</blockquote>
			Unlike most despotic Fediverse fifedom operators, Freezepeach server operators refrain from exercizing their right to censor users for the myriad of reasons above, <b>with the exception of obscenity and fedposting</b>.
			<br>
			<br>
			Obscenity: The interpretation of obscenity varies slightly from person to person (for example, some consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolicon" target="_blank">loli</a> to be child pornography (and therefore obscene), while others do not. However, telling someone that they're "fat and wrong" is not obscene by any reasonable definition.
			<br>
			Fedposting: Government agents have been known to goad and provoke retarded and mentally ill people into acts of barbarism. Section 230 provides no protection from criminal liability, and therefore allows goverments to use agents and informants to entrap service operators (through their inaction).
